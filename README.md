## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Justinas

I'm a beginner data analyst passionate about turning data into insights. With a background in client relations and sales, Iâ€™ve developed a strong analytical mindset and problem-solving skills. Now, Iâ€™m focused on learning SQL, Excel, and data visualization to start my career in data analytics.  

ðŸ”¹ **Skills:** SQL | Excel | Data Visualization (Power BI/Tableau)  
ðŸ”¹ **Currently Learning:** Advanced SQL, Python for Data Analysis  
ðŸ”¹ **Projects:**  
- [Sales Data Analysis](https://github.com/JustinasBazevicius/SQL-BigQuery-) - Analyzing sales trends and customer behavior using SQL.
